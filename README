I've returned to Natural Language Databasing. I have dropped entirely the construction of any program. Instead, I will use existing programs such as Wolfram Alpha, Google, and, if I can possibly find one, something that actually claims to be a Natural Language Database as examples in a paper discussing a theorized Natural Language Database using a Prolog backend and an imperative (Perl) frontend. I'll update my abstract later today.

I've got extremely simple grammar and vocabulary sets, and now I'm setting up the perl engine. I'm no longer heading towards a goal of a Natural-Language-Database, but my simpler backup plan, the paper rewriter, described in more detail in my abstract.

I've settled on a prolog-based natural language recognition scheme. Right now I'm working on picking up prolog, but well in time for next week I'll have something more substantial.
