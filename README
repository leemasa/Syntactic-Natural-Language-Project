Paper is now eighteen pages including references and one image. Flowchart has been added to elucidate how the three components work together.

Nine pages into a paper. The background of natural language parsing as a general practice is written, and now I've got to write the advantages of using Prolog as both the natural language parser and the expert system parts of a database, and describe how a dual-Prolog database would handle various aspects of a Natural Language Database.

I've returned to Natural Language Databasing. I have dropped entirely the construction of any program. Instead, I will use existing programs such as Wolfram Alpha, Google, and, if I can possibly find one, something that actually claims to be a Natural Language Database as examples in a paper discussing a theorized Natural Language Database using a Prolog backend and an imperative (Perl) frontend. My abstract has been appropriately updated.

Got a local directory using Cygwin on my personal laptop

I've got extremely simple grammar and vocabulary sets, and now I'm setting up the perl engine. I'm no longer heading towards a goal of a Natural-Language-Database, but my simpler backup plan, the paper rewriter, described in more detail in my abstract.

I've settled on a prolog-based natural language recognition scheme. Right now I'm working on picking up prolog, but well in time for next week I'll have something more substantial.
