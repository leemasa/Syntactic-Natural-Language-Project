With millions of papers on various subjects on the internet and sophisticated methods of copying and pasting available to anyone with a word processor, plagiarism has become frighteningly simple. Unfortunately, recognizing a work that has been plagiarized is distinctly less trivial.
Analyzing a paper for writing style is a popular method for recognizing whether a paper was really written by the person turning it in. Statistical analysis of word use and sentence structure can spot a sudden change in voice, indicating the work of a different author.
As a test of style analysis techniques, the program "Paper-matic" analyzes a paper and writes another paper of a similar style. Using an intelligent vocabulary list and a set of grammatical rules, it reads and observes the characteristics of a text and reproduces them in an arbitrary length paper randomly generated based on the vocabulary and structural statistics harvested from the analysis.
